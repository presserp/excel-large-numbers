Calculation of large numbers in Excel in VBA

This repository contains a free add-in for calculating large numbers in Excel. Mourad Louha's first developed this in 2010. Eric Presser started contributing to this in 2017. The Add-In currently implements functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, exponentiation, quotient and mod of large numbers. The code in the Add-In is password protected; however you can unprotect the VBA project by using the password “excel-ticker” (without the quotes). The Add-In includes the functions which can be accessed, for example, through the category “User defined” of the select function box in Excel. Each function of the Add-In is available in English, German and French. The “Karatsuba algorithm” is used for addition, subtraction, multiplication and exponentiation. The true long school division algorithm is used for quotient and mod.
